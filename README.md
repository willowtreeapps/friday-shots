Friday Shots
=============

How To Officiate
----------------
* Run `run.py` with a list of names as arguments (full names please!)
** For example, `python run.py abrahamlincoln mattdamon nickofferman bertmacklin`
* If players join late, you can manually edit the `data.json` file after the game has ended.
** Scroll to the bottom of the file, and add a boolean.
** Run the edited json through a JSON validator just to be sure it's valid.
* Run `stats.py` with the `data.json` file as an argument
** For example, `python stats.py data.json`
** This will output the current statistics to the command line
* Copy and paste the statistics from the command line to this `README.md` file, replacing the section below, "Players' records"
* Push up your changes!

Rules
-----
1. The competition begins every Friday promptly at beer thirty (once at least one person has opened a beer and it is 4:30pm or later).
2. Anyone in the office at the time of the competition can participate.
3. No practice shots can be taken once the competition begins.
4. Each participant gets to take one shot after paying the $1 entry fee (greenbacks only!). All fees must be paid  
   prior to the first shot.
5. All shooters who hit the gong will split the pot.

Rule Changes
------------
* Rule changes will be discussed among an ad hoc committee.
* If implemented, rule changes must go into effect the day of and at a time after a competition.
* Rule changes dealing with the gong strikage success criteria (GSSC) will be decided upon by an official WillowTree Apps vote and must be carried by at least 66% of non-abstaining voters.  A minimum of 15% of employees must carry any GSSC rule changes.

Gong Strikage Success Criteria
------------------------------
1. The participant must have both of his or her feet on the ground, behind the back edge (the edge furthest from the gong) of the blue tape.
2. The participant must use the original blue nerf pistol. It is especially noted
   Derek may not use his own nerf gun.
3. The dart must strike the gong, but not the line or hanging apparatus of the gong. 
4. Only bank shots off the back wall (the wall the gong is attached to) count as
   a hit unless the shooter calls "bank". If the shooter calls bank then non-
   bank shots don't count. Hitting anything other than the back wall disqualifies
   the shot.
5. Though successful gong strikage generally results in a pleasing gong sound, audible indications of success are not stictly required.


Friday Shots Enhancement Proposals (FSEPs)
------------------------------------------
FSEP 1 - It has been suggested that multiple shots may be purchased on an increasing
     cost scale - eg 2 shots for $5 - note that this will require modification to the
     accompanying software.
